      Aristarchus is one of the brighest formations on the lunar surface, possessing an albedo significantly higher than most lunar features. When the Moon is illuminated by earthshine, the entire crater can be visible with the naked eye. Aristarchus is around 3.7 km deep, which is even deeper than the Grand Canyon! Aristarchus has been closely studied in recent years because of multiple transient lunar phenomena happening at the crater. Transient lunar phenomena refers to a noticeable change in color for an area on the moon. These changes in color were accompanied with a significant presence of radon-222 emissions. <br><br>
      Aristarchus was named after the Ancient Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos. Aristarchus was among the first to present a heliocentric model of the solar system, accurately putting the Sun as a central fixture that the Earth orbits around. He even accurately ascertained that there were stars aside from the Sun that existed far away from Earth. However, he was unable to prove this due to a lack of necessary scientific tools.
